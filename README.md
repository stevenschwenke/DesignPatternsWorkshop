DesignPatternsWorkshop
==============

This bulk repository is a draft for a Workshop for design patterns. Often, design patterns like the one described in the famous "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" are barely known by developers. Even if the names of the patterns are known, the implementation isn't. This workshop will tackle both problems: knowing about the design patterns and being able to implement them properly.

Creational Patterns
----------------------
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Object Mother
- Abstract Factory

Behavioral Patterns
----------------------
- todo

For each pattern
- the basic principle will be told,
- the implementation shown
- and the usage in specific situations discussed. 

To practice the patterns, we will enhance a given code base step by step using the patterns.
