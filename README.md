DesignPatternsWorkshop
==============

This bulk repository is a draft for a Workshop for design patterns. Often, design patterns like the one described in the famous "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" are barely known by developers. Even if the names of the patterns are known, the implementation isn't. This workshop will tackle both problems: knowing about the design patterns and being able to implement them properly.
